# How User Stories Are Chunked

This document describes how Holoplan processes user stories and transforms them into structured UI view plans using a dedicated LLM agent (`chunker.go`).

---

## üìò Overview

Holoplan reads user stories from a YAML file and feeds them, one at a time, into a local LLM via the `Chunk()` agent. The LLM returns a structured JSON payload describing the UI views required to satisfy the story. Each view includes its name, type, and components.

    A[Start: Load YAML File]
    B[Parse into array of UserStory structs]
    C[Loop through each UserStory]
    D[Send narrative to Chunk Agent]
    E[Chunk Agent calls local LLM with system + user prompt]
    F[LLM returns JSON object with views and reasoning]
    G[Clean JSON via extractCleanJSON]
    H[Parse into ViewPlan struct]
    I[Assign story ID to ViewPlan]
    J[Return ViewPlan to main loop]

# Chunk Agent Interaction: Sequence Diagram

This diagram shows the step-by-step sequence of how the Holoplan system interacts with the `Chunk` agent and the local LLM to transform a user story into structured views.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as holoplan-cli
    participant YAML as user_stories.yaml
    participant CHUNKER as chunker.go
    participant LLM as local LLM (Ollama)
    participant JSON as extractCleanJSON()
    participant VIEW as ViewPlan Parser

    CLI->>YAML: Read YAML into []UserStory
    CLI->>CHUNKER: Send one UserStory to Chunk()
    CHUNKER->>LLM: Send prompt with story.narrative
    LLM-->>CHUNKER: Return raw JSON + optional reasoning
    CHUNKER->>JSON: Sanitize and extract valid JSON
    JSON-->>CHUNKER: Cleaned JSON string
    CHUNKER->>VIEW: Parse into ViewPlan struct
    VIEW-->>CHUNKER: ViewPlan with views + metadata
    CHUNKER-->>CLI: Return structured ViewPlan
```

## üîç Example

**Input YAML:**

```yaml
- id: "US-101"
  title: "Browse Indoor Plants"
  narrative: |
    As a plant enthusiast,
    I want to browse a list of indoor plants,
    so that I can choose one that suits my home environment.
```

**LLM Prompt:**

```text
User story:
As a plant enthusiast,
I want to browse a list of indoor plants,
so that I can choose one that suits my home environment.
```

**Expected JSON Response:**

```json
{
  "views": [
    {
      "name": "Plant Gallery",
      "type": "GridView",
      "components": ["Plant Image", "Plant Name", "Lighting Icon", "Add to Favorites"]
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The story is about browsing a list of plants, so a grid-based gallery with key details is appropriate."
}
```

## üß† Agent Logic Summary

* Uses temperature 0 and deterministic seed
* Extracts raw JSON from noisy LLM outputs using `extractCleanJSON()`
* Escapes embedded newlines and trims `<think>` tags
* Logs view extraction and errors for traceability
