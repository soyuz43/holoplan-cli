    When a user first opens the app, they should feel like they’re being welcomed —
    kind of like how Netflix suggests stuff right away. So maybe show them a banner
    or like a section that gives them a quick idea of what's new, or what they might
    be interested in. It doesn’t have to be fancy, but it should feel curated.

    There needs to be a way for people to submit questions about dog breeds,
    especially if they're not sure which breed is right for them. This could be
    a form, or maybe even like a chatbot interface? Also we might want to capture
    contact info here too just in case we need to follow up.

    We want an admin dashboard, but it shouldn’t be overwhelming. Just basic stuff
    like how many dogs are listed, pending adoptions, maybe some quick stats or a graph.
    It’d be nice if there was some kind of alert system too, like "3 adoption requests
    need approval" or whatever. Think lightweight, not Salesforce.
