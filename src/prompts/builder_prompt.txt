Instructions:
- Output must be ONLY Draw.io XML.
- Do not include markdown, explanation, or code comments.
- Begin output with <mxGraphModel> and include a <root> with nested <mxCell> elements.
- Each component should be represented as a rectangle, clearly labeled.
- Position components logically on a 2D plane.

Your output will be parsed and validated automatically. Any extra text will cause a failure.
